# TicTacToe

This is a basic TicTacToe program. It is run on Gradle (the build.gradle file is in the repo)
- The program is compiled using: `gradle build`
- It is executed using: `gradle run`

The application prompts the user to enter a number which corresponds to a box on the board. It does not accept anything besides numbers between 1-9 inclusive. 

The program will continue until the user either quits (by entering "-1"), the game is tied, or there is a winner.

Enjoy!
